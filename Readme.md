# Hi! My name is Lyaylya. 
# I am a participant of cgs camp
# My programming journey began at school in 9th grade. 
# We have started to learn python, solve problems and we build our own websites using html. 
# After several programming experiences I liked the process of coding, so I decided to pick a CS major. 
# Now I am on the 1st year of UG, and I am excited to begin my tech journey
# as summer started I have seen the new post of acmw, about this camp
# i was excited because I thought that it is a great opportubity to boost my coding skills
# so that's how I ended up here
